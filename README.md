# DeepLearningExam
This project entitled sentiment analysis using NLP, has been done by me and my colleague Chaima Haj Taher as a part of our module Deep Learning with InstaDeep. Supervised by M. Fares El Kahla and Ms. Sabrine Krichen.
The main goal of this project is to build an algorithm capable of identifying sentiment types based on the textual tweets dataset (positive or negative). To investigate the sentiment analysis field of deep learning since it allows us to approach natural language processing which is a very hot topic nowadays.

1-the project is attatched to a requirements.txt file with all python packages that need to be installed.

2- The used dataset: the sentiment140 dataset. It contains 1,600,000 tweets extracted using the twitter api . The tweets have been annotated (0 = negative, 4 = positive) and they can be used to detect sentiment.

3-Define the model

4-Training

5-Model evaluation

6-Pretrained model: use of BERT pre-trained model.
