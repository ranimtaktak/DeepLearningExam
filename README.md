# DeepLearningExam
This project entitled sentiment analysis using NLP, has been done by me and my colleague Chaima Haj Taher as a part of our module Deep Learning with InstaDeep. Supervised by M. Fares El Kahla and Ms. Sabrine Krichen.
The main goal of this project is to build an algorithm capable of identifying sentiment types based on the textual tweets dataset (positive or negative). To investigate the sentiment analysis field of deep learning since it allows us to approach natural language processing which is a very hot topic nowadays.
